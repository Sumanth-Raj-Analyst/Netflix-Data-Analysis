# Netflix Data Analysis and Power BI Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing **Netflix data** using Power BI. The dataset includes various attributes about Netflix movies and TV shows, such as the title, release year, genre, rating, country, and more. The goal of the analysis is to explore patterns and trends in Netflix's content library and present them visually through interactive dashboards.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about Netflix's movies and TV shows. It includes attributes like:
- **Title**: The name of the movie or TV show.
- **Release Year**: The year the movie or TV show was released.
- **Genre**: The category of content (e.g., Drama, Comedy, Action).
- **Rating**: The rating given to the show or movie.
- **Country**: The country where the content was produced or available.
- **Duration**: Length of the content (for movies, it’s in minutes; for TV shows, it’s the number of seasons).

The dataset was downloaded from **[Kaggle's Netflix Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)**, which provides a comprehensive overview of Netflix's library.

## Project Objective
The goal of this project was to create an interactive **Power BI dashboard** that allows users to explore key insights from the Netflix dataset. The analysis focuses on:
1. **Content distribution by genre**: A breakdown of Netflix's content by genre.
2. **Content release trends**: Exploring the release years of movies and TV shows.
3. **Top countries**: Identifying which countries contribute the most to Netflix's content.
4. **Rating distribution**: Visualizing the rating distribution of Netflix movies and TV shows.

## Key Features of the Power BI Dashboard
The **Power BI dashboard** created in this project includes several visualizations:
- **Bar charts** for genre distribution.
- **Line charts** to track the number of movies/TV shows released per year.
- **Pie charts** for content distribution across different countries.
- **Filters** to allow users to drill down by rating, genre, and country.

These features allow for deeper insights and a better understanding of Netflix's content strategy.

## How the Project Was Done
1. **Data Cleaning**: The data was cleaned and preprocessed in Power BI to ensure accuracy in the analysis. Missing values were handled, and columns with irrelevant information were removed.
2. **Data Analysis**: Key metrics were derived, including counts of movies/TV shows by genre, release year, country, and ratings.
3. **Visualization**: Using Power BI, interactive charts were created to display these insights. The dashboard allows users to filter and explore the data dynamically.
4. **Interactivity**: Users can filter the data by specific genres, ratings, or years. This enables viewers to dive deeper into the data and uncover specific trends.

## How to Use the Power BI Dashboard
If you want to replicate or explore the project further:
1. **Download the Dataset**: Get the Netflix dataset from Kaggle or use your own version.
2. **Open Power BI**: Import the dataset into Power BI Desktop.
3. **Recreate the Dashboard**: Follow the steps above to clean, analyze, and visualize the data.
4. **Interactive Features**: Use the slicers and filters to explore different aspects of the Netflix dataset.

## Future Improvements
- **Data Enrichment**: Adding additional datasets, such as user reviews or movie/TV show metadata, to further analyze viewer preferences.
- **More Visualizations**: Adding more complex visualizations like geographic maps to show distribution by country.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Implementing machine learning or advanced analytics to predict Netflix's future content strategies based on trends.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Power BI can be used to analyze and visualize large datasets in an interactive way. By exploring Netflix's content library, this analysis provides insights into the trends and patterns that shape Netflix’s global success.
